# Project Rules for Cursor

- Controllers must stay minimal and orchestration-only:
  - Keep controller classes as simple as possible.
  - Do not place business logic in controllers.
  - Delegate all business rules, validation, and data access to service layer(s).
  - Controllers should only:
    - Parse/validate request shape (DTO-level), 
    - Call service methods,
    - Map entities to response DTOs,
    - Set appropriate HTTP status codes.
