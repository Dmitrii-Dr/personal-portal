# Project Rules for Cursor

- Controllers must stay minimal and orchestration-only:
  - Keep controller classes as simple as possible.
  - Do not place business logic in controllers.
  - Delegate all business rules, validation, and data access to service layer(s).
  - Controllers should only:
    - Parse/validate request shape (DTO-level), 
    - Call service methods,
    - Map entities to response DTOs,
    - Set appropriate HTTP status codes.

- Never expose database entities through API:
  - Controllers must NEVER return JPA entities (e.g., User, Booking, Article) directly.
  - Always use DTOs/Response objects (e.g., UserResponse, BookingResponse, AdminBookingResponse).
  - Map entities to DTOs before returning from controller methods.
  - This prevents exposing internal database structure, passwords, and other sensitive fields.
